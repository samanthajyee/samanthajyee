### Wholeness as Practice: Meeting Samantha Yee Across Mediums

You can meet Samantha Yee in many ways.

You might stumble across her poetry first—verses that crackle like firecrackers in the alley, then dissolve into rain and birdseed. Her chapbook reads like an altar, stitched from ancestral threads and the sweetness of survival. Every line feels lived, not just written. There’s a tenderness there that doesn’t flinch. The kind that comes from someone who knows what it means to endure, and to name joy anyway.

Or maybe you meet her on [GitHub](https://github.com/samanthajyee). You scroll past profiles filled with pull-request stats and lists of programming languages, and suddenly hers stops you. It's clean but warm, technical yet unmistakably human. She writes code with the precision of a builder and the posture of a caretaker. Her projects speak to a different kind of tech culture—one rooted in wholeness, accessibility, and collective care.

Then there's her children's book. Written as a series of blessings to the three dogs she shares her home with, it reads like a daily ritual, equal parts lullaby and love letter. It’s not saccharine. It’s sacred. There’s something deeply subversive about writing this way to small beings, affirming their goodness not because they’ve earned it, but because they exist.

Her web design [portfolio site](https://samanthajyee.webflow.io/) feels like a mirror of all this: intentional, poetic, uncompromising. She doesn’t separate the work from the worker. The fonts and animations breathe. The case studies read like stories. Even her About page feels like a place to exhale. You can tell she’s done client work, yes—but you can also tell she’s doing soul work. And she expects you to bring your whole self too.

Across all these touchpoints, what’s remarkable isn’t just what Samantha makes. It’s how she moves.

Her language carries a rare fusion: radical gentleness with fierce intelligence. She designs systems like she writes poems, attuned to every edge and undercurrent. You can tell she’s deeply spiritual, but not in the commodified sense. Her faith is quiet, elemental, stitched into her verbs. She doesn’t need to brand her values—they’re just present.

It’s tempting to categorize her: poet, developer, designer, activist, educator. But categories collapse in her presence. She’s not juggling identities. She’s integrating them. And in doing so, she creates something rare: a practice of living in public without distortion.

If you meet her work—whether through a WMNCAP lending circle, a website, an app launch, or a book-signing—consider yourself invited.
Not just to view it, but to feel it. To slow down. To return to yourself.

Samantha Yee is building more than projects.
She’s building new ways to be.
